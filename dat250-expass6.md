# Assignment 6 - MVC and SPA
The goal of this assignment is to create a SPA web application using Angular as well as creating an example for the MVC model, provided by a tutorial.

## Technical problems
Only one problem was faced: the CORS error. It was adressed thanks to the instructions given in a [Canvas announcement](https://hvl.instructure.com/courses/21915/discussion_topics/252362).
