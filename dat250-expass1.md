# Lab report
The goal of this session is to ensure that we have a working IDE as well as getting in touch with Heroku. All the steps below have been done in a Windows 11 Home machine.


## Installation
This step only required the installation of Maven, as the rest of the software required (JDK, Eclipse and Git client) was already istalled and has been used during previous semesters and therefore validated.

[This](https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.8.6/binaries/apache-maven-3.8.6-bin.zip) is the version that I downloaded and installed.

In order to check that the installation was carried out successfully I runned `mvn -v` in the command line and obtained an output as the following:
```
Apache Maven 3.8.6 (84538c9988a25aec085021c365c560670ad80f63)
Maven home: C:\Windows\apache-maven-3.8.6
Java version: 18.0.1, vendor: Oracle Corporation, runtime: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-18.0.1
Default locale: es_ES, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "windows 11", version: "10.0", arch: "amd64", family: "windows"
```
## Experiment
For the experiment it was required to have installed locally Postgres. [This](https://www.enterprisedb.com/postgresql-tutorial-resources-training?uuid=db55e32d-e9f0-4d7c-9aef-b17d01210704&campaignId=7012J000001NhszQAC) is the version that was downloaded and installed.

While running the experiment no technical problems were encountered.
